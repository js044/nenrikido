*Current Number of Library Entries*: 73

This page is a collection of media that I have personally found interesting and/or useful. As such, it should not be treated as a neutral or unbiased selection.
- In the spirit of maintaining a digital "library," items listed are free. All posts have a "Check out" link that allows you to download or view the content.
    - *Note*: Some Internet Archive links require you to have an account to read books.
- Something being in the library does not necessarily mean I endorse it wholesale. I disagree with several entries to varying extents. Think of these titles as "food for thought" rather than "uncritical approval."
- On that note, I encourage you to engage with any material in this library critically. Take notes, write rebuttals, compare concepts and themes, and compile questions to pursue further.
- Content is very, very loosely organized and incomplete. Expect the library to grow and undergo a variety of organizational changes over time.
- I have not specified content warnings for individual entries; please proceed with caution.
- This library is best perused with a warm beverage in hand, preferably while it's raining.

If you have library recommendations, want to report broken links, or have any thoughts on the selection, feel free to leave a comment.

Hartmann" date="1979" category="Essays" length="33 pages" genre="Feminism, Politics, Nonfiction" summary="This paper argues that the relation between marxism and feminism has, in all the forms it has so far taken, been an unequal one. While both marxist method and feminist analysis are necessary to an understanding of capitalist societies, and of the position of women within them, in fact feminism has consistently been subordinated. The paper presents a challenge to both marxist and radical feminist work on the 'woman question', and argues that what it is necessary to analyse is the combination of patriarchy and capitalism. It is a paper which, we hope, should stimulate considerable debate." link="https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~hoganr/SOC%20602/Hartmann_1979" >}}

Zainichi typically refers to a specific group of “foreigners” residing in postwar Japan—Korean residents who can trace their diasporic roots to Japan’s colonial rule of Korea (1910-1945). Throughout postwar Japanese history, the Zainichi experience has been a complicated one, as it has been informed by racism in Japan as well as by Japan and Korea’s postwar relationship. My dissertation looks at literary arts produced by Zainichi women, with a special focus on the illocutionary power of autobiographical expression as a means to promote social change and equality in contemporary Japanese society." link="https://escholarship.org/content/qt1jp6k3wg/qt1jp6k3wg_noSplash_9128ecae1bfd559e3774a52be3234672.pdf?t=p6piqw" >}}

These essays explore and illuminate the roots of Lorde's intellectual development and her deep-seated and longstanding concerns about ways of increasing empowerment among minority women writers and the absolute necessity to explicate the concept of difference—difference according to sex, race, and economic status. The title Sister Outsider finds its source in her poetry collection The Black Unicorn (1978). These poems and the essays in Sister Outsider stress Lorde's oft-stated theme of continuity, particularly of the geographical and intellectual link between Dahomey, Africa, and her emerging self." link="https://archive.org/details/sisteroutsideres00lord/mode/2up?view=theater" >}}

Even progressive practitioners tend to assume that it is essentially well constructed and benign. This article shows otherwise. The article fundamentally problematizes PTSD. It demonstrates that the category PTSD is confused, reductionist, contradictory, and arbitrary and that it pathologizes purposeful and valuable coping strategies commonly used by people who are traumatized. It demonstrates, in addition, that the category does not even serve the purpose for which progressive therapists have engaged with the diagnosis and that it cannot simply be 'corrected.'" link="https://www.brown.uk.com/diagnosis/burstow.pdf" >}}

Metzl" date="2010" category="Books" length="246 pages" genre="Race, Politics, History, Psychiatry" summary="The civil rights era is largely remembered as a time of sit-ins, boycotts, and riots. But a very different civil rights history evolved at the Ionia State Hospital for the Criminally Insane in Ionia, Michigan. In The Protest Psychosis, psychiatrist and cultural critic Jonathan Metzl tells the shocking story of how schizophrenia became the diagnostic term overwhelmingly applied to African American protesters at Ionia—for political reasons as well as clinical ones. Expertly sifting through a vast array of cultural documents, Metzl shows how associations between schizophrenia and blackness emerged during the tumultuous decades of the 1960s and 1970s—and he provides a cautionary tale of how anxieties about race continue to impact doctor-patient interactions in our seemingly postracial America." link="https://archive.org/details/protestpsychosis0000metz" >}}

Perfect for the general reader, as well as students, it offers a comprehensive yet lucid rendering of the conflict, setting it in its proper historical context. Harms and Ferry show how today's violence is very much a product of recent history, with its roots in the twentieth century.

{{< library-card filter="books" title="The Hour of the Star" author="Clarice Lispector" date="February 17, 1992" category="Books" length="96 pages" genre="Classics, Fiction" summary="Narrated by the cosmopolitan Rodrigo S.M., this brief, strange, and haunting tale is the story of Macabéa, one of life's unfortunates. Living in the slums of Rio de Janeiro and eking out a poor living as a typist, Macabéa loves movies, Coca-Cola, and her rat of a boyfriend; she would like to be like Marilyn Monroe, but she is ugly, underfed, sickly, and unloved. Rodrigo recoils from her wretchedness, and yet he cannot avoid realization that for all her outward misery, Macabéa is inwardly free. She doesn't seem to know how unhappy she should be. Lispector employs her pathetic heroine against her urbane, empty narrator--edge of despair to edge of despair--and, working them like a pair of scissors, she cuts away the reader's preconceived notions about poverty, identity, love, and the art of fiction. In her last novel she takes readers close to the true mystery of life, and leaves us deep in Lispector territory indeed." link="https://archive.org/details/hourofst00lisp/mode/2up?view=theater" >}}

But more than just a novel of adventure, more than an encyclopaedia of whaling lore and legend, the book can be seen as part of its author's lifelong meditation on America. Written with wonderfully redemptive humour, Moby-Dick is also a profound inquiry into character, faith, and the nature of perception." link="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2701" >}}

It is the story of a young man who, transformed overnight into a giant beetle-like insect, becomes an object of disgrace to his family, an outsider in his own home, a quintessentially alienated man.

But his real problem is not the enemy—it is his own army, which keeps increasing the number of missions the men must fly to complete their service. Yet if Yossarian makes any attempt to excuse himself from the perilous missions he’s assigned, he’ll be in violation of Catch-22, a hilariously sinister bureaucratic rule: a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he makes a formal request to be removed from duty, he is proven sane and therefore ineligible to be relieved." link="https://archive.org/details/Catch22_201808/page/n5/mode/2up?view=theater" >}}

The connections between fossil fuels and whaling are an example of the unanticipated consequences that frequently come with technological change. I draw on political-economic theory to explain why fossil fuels served to escalate rather than eliminate whaling. The case of whaling highlights the limited potential for technological developments to help overcome environmental problems without concurrent political, economic, and social change that supports conservation." link="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2378023117739217" >}}
