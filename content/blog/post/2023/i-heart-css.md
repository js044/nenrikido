This site has become a sort of digital chew toy for me. I am the sort of person who paces when I'm frustrated, the sort of person who is so bad at sitting with stress that it's palpable. I have been very stressed this 2023! And so I chew.

Most recently, I was haunted by how janky my window box sizing was and how scrunched it would get on smaller screens. So, I got to messing with the CSS and spent a few days just ironing out weird code and cleaning up leftover CSS from other maintenance sessions. Maybe I really should look into SASS...

I'm actually kind of stunned at how much I've learned though. I didn't really expect much when I started this site, but I guess rewriting the CSS for your site over and over (not done yet btw) is a good exercise. Furthermore, I accidentally got hooked on this guy's [channel](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) (I've been watching his videos while I paint the walls) and then I get an itch to fix stuff.

I've mentioned it before on this blog, but CSS is really easy to get started with, and not so easy to master. Anyone can throw on a display:flex property, but understanding the nuances of flex-basis and responsive units well enough to make functional, complex layouts takes a little more experimenting. And don't get me started on how robust CSS grid is. (And it seems like it'll only be getting even more powerful once more browsers start adopting CSS grid module 3, which has features like [native masonry](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/native-css-masonry-layout-css-grid/)!)
