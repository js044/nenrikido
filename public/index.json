[{"content":"This post was originally part of a different post (yet to be published), but it’s gotten so unwieldy and long that I’ve decided to chop it up into smaller posts. Basically, I’ve recently started setting up a home server with an Orange Pi Zero 3 to host a few applications with Docker. I decided to look into dashboard applications, and after a bit of trial-and-error and lucky timing, landed on Homarr. This post is just me showing off my Homarr setup (with details on how to recreate it) and briefly reviewing other options currently available.\nMy use case was a little bit different from what a lot of server dashboards try to be–I wanted standard dashboard functionality, but I also wanted a drop-in replacement for my internet startpage. I’ve been using start.me for the last few years, which works nicely, but I’d prefer something that’s all-in-one. This meant I needed a server dashboard that also supported RSS feed aggregation (for news feeds), widgets, and groupable bookmarks. The more customizable, the better.\nThe long and short of it is that Homarr suits my specific needs best, although Dashy sounds just as good on paper. I actually almost moved on from Homarr because it was pretty clunky, but the next day I saw they were starting up a beta that would address some of the issues I was having. I switched over to the beta and really enjoyed it. As of just a few days ago, Homarr officially rolled this version out as a stable release. It’s really a lot better, although it has a few idiosyncracies that I thought would be useful to document here.\nBefore we get to that though, here’s a look at my Homarr setup:\nI won’t go over all of the installation instructions here. You can find step-by-step instructions on installing Homarr with Docker Compose on Homarr's website.\nA few random notes about Homarr that might be useful to someone testing it out:\nIf you want to add bookmarks, you’ll have to add them as apps. Creating apps isn’t a very straightforward process, but you can add /manage/apps to your URL to jump straight to the apps list. Here, you can add new ones. Apps can be implemented as either, well…apps, or bookmark links. You may notice that you can customize the icons. If you’re using Simple Icons, you can add a hex code to the end of the link to change the SVG color. And as of the new release, you can upload your own icons super simply. I couldn’t find an all white version for Dashdot or Baikal, so I made white SVGs in Illustrator and used the Dropbox URL until this update allowed me to upload them directly. Here are the Baikal and Dashdot SVGs, in case anyone needs them. The iframes is a pretty cool feature! I chose this Pomodoro timer (I use a different background for each workspace in Zen browser), but you could get creative and try out lots of things. I’d recommend looking into Notion embeds for inspiration. They might not all work 1:1, but it’s worth checking out. I think I might try out the virtual cafe as an iframe next. This is more of an edge case thing, but if you use Zen Browser, set Homarr to your new tab page, and notice your bookmarks not loading when you swap to different workspaces, make sure you actually log in. This should fix it. From what I can tell, Homarr is not mobile friendly. Not sure if I’m just missing a setting, but I couldn’t figure out a way to make it look nice. Maybe that’s coming in a future update. I found the “Dynamic category” feature very buggy and unstable. I didn’t really need it for my setup, so this wasn’t a big deal for me, but if it matters to you, just know it’s not really useable yet. If you attempt to modify your Homarr CSS, be sure to use the semantic Mantime class names instead of the names it automatically generates. You can find them with the developer tools. There isn’t great documentation as to what each class name represents, and if I ever get to customizing Homarr some more, I might try my hand at it. I used this Unsplash photo as my background and matched my Zen browser gradient to it, then customized my Homarr CSS to look how I wanted it to. Here’s my CSS:\nA few warnings about my CSS:\nIt’s not perfect. Dialog modals inherit translucence and I haven’t figured out how to make them more opaque/legible yet. The RGB colors are set to a palette that matches my background image and the hex codes I set in my Homarr colors settings (a primary color of #1c5e28 and a secondary color of #d6d385.) Some of the gray font is a little hard to read. I haven’t figured out which class to target yet. Maybe some other time. And that’s all there really is to it. I’m happy with Homarr. The drag and drop functionality is nice, it’s flexible without being overwhelming, and despite its quirks, it’s perfect for what I need. I’m satisfied with my layout for now, but I can already think of a lot of different iterations that’d look nice and fit different themes.\nBut just for posterity, let’s go over Homarr’s competition. If you think a self-hosted dashboard sounds neat, but you’re not impressed with what Homarr has to offer, perhaps one of these would be a better fit. Here were my (super subjective) impressions:\nHomepage: Gorgeous. I wanted this to work out so badly, especially because it’s so popular. But the lack of native RSS feeds is a deal breaker for me, and I also found some of the grid behavior a little frustrating. I know you can set up a custom API widget, but I couldn’t get this to work. Probably user error, but still. You have to edit a config file to get everything working, which was not a big deal for me, but be aware there isn’t a WSIWYG editor. Heimdall: Another popular option, but it didn’t resonate with me and wasn’t feature-rich enough to support my use case. This is good as a no-frills server dashboard. Dashy: It’s extremely popular, and it’s quite customizable. I like how browser bookmarks are handled. It also supports RSS feeds, which is great. Performs build during each startup, which has led to complaints of server performance. But there are lots of nice Dashy setups; it seems well-suited to power users. Flame: If I just wanted bookmarks and links, I think I’d choose Flame. It’s so sleek and minimal. I love the look of the weather widget. It’s also uncluttered and easy to find what you need. Homer: Another popular dashboard choice. The aesthetics weren’t to my personal tastes, but it looks quite polished and functional. It seems to have decent community support as well. I know this post is a little more niche than what I usually post about, but self-hosting is really fun and not prohibitively difficult, so I hope it becomes a more popular project. I’ll elaborate on specific steps I took and ways to test out Docker applications even without dedicated hardware (hint: WSL 2) in the home server master post.\nIf you self-host, do you use any of these dashboards? If you don’t, would you?\n","description":"","tags":["recs"],"title":"Homarr and Other Self-hosted Dashboards","uri":"/blog/post/homarr/"},{"content":"So, Neocities…isn’t exactly equipped for heavy editing. The code editor is limited in its functionality and the file upload process is so simple that it actually becomes cumbersome. Its simplicity is one of its selling points, but trying to update your site can get very tedious, very fast, especially the more it grows.\nAfter a failed attempt at wrangling the native Neocities GUI and messing up my file structure, I decided I wanted to simply abstract it away. I found two primary ways to do so, but neither had a ton of documentation, and as someone who was still just getting started with web development, it took a bit of extra care to get everything working. I’ll just be reiterating the instructions for both deployment methods with a little extra context and guidance for anyone who needs it.\nI’m using a static site generator (Hugo), but the methods outlined here will work even if you aren’t.\nOPTION 1: Neocities CLI Neocities has an official, supported command line interface tool to upload your website. This is a good option if you want to decouple your site from GitHub, and/or if you are comfortable with the command line. Even if neither of these apply, this tool is still functional and straightforward. It’s what I used initially, but it’s been a year since then, so if any of this information is out-of-date, please do correct me. If you’d like to get started, you must:\nInstall Ruby. Your install method will depend on your OS. On Linux, you could run sudo apt-get install ruby-full On Windows, you’d use Ruby Installer. Open your command prompt and install the Neocities CLI with gem install neocities Type neocities to pull up a list of subcommands. It should look like this: To push your site, copy the URL of your public directory (very important for SSGs) and then use the command neocities push to publish it via the command line. In my case, whenever I wanted to push updates, the full command was neocities push /home/jay/Documents/Code/nenrikido/public Notes When you first attempt to utilize any of the subcommands, it will prompt you to input your site name and password, then locally store your API key for future use. File uploads can feel pretty slow. The tool checks every single file in your folders to see if they’re already uploaded on Neocities, and if you have hundreds of files (like if you have, say, a gallery), it can get tedious to watch. This is especially true if you only want to upload one or two files. I haven’t quantified the time difference between uploading changes with the CLI vs. the GitHub Action, but the latter definitely seems faster. If you locally delete a file in your public directory, it won’t automatically delete it from Neocities. This is presumably to make sure you don’t accidentally lose data, but it can cause unexpected consequences. If you want to delete a file or folder, make sure you manually delete it locally and also on Neocities. If your site is on GitHub and you’d like to use this tool, you can use a Git hook to deploy to Neocities whenever you push changes to GitHub. However, for this usecase, I think it’d likely be simpler to just use the next method. OPTION 2: Deply to Neocities (GitHub Action) Once I put my site on GitHub, it seemed natural to switch over to the popular Github Action that publishes your site updates on Neocities whenever you push updates to your Github repository. Convenient! I think this is the obvious choice if your site is on GitHub, which is something I would generally recommend.\nThese steps assume that you’ve already 1. pushed your site to GitHub and 2. have no workflows yet. To get it up and running:\nCreate a folder called .github in your root directory. Within this folder, create another folder called workflows Create a file called neocities.yml Using this basic template, fill out your workflow. Your usecase will likely vary from what is outlined here. For example, if you’re not using node, you obviously won’t need to involve those steps. You can see my very basic implementation here. You can also look through all the sites that are dependent on it to see how they set up their configuration if you need examples. Fetch your API token from https://neocities.org/settings/{{your-sitename}}#api_key Set your API token as a GitHub secret (for security reasons) and name it NEOCITIES_API_TOKEN Make sure your dist_dir is set to whatever directory you want published on Neocities and have at it! Notes This will work on a private repository. The cleanup field can be set to true or false. Your choice determies whether you want to delete files on Neocities that aren’t in your Github directory. It is set to false on default, but I set it to true because I have a tendency to change up my file structures, which leaves orphaned files on Neocities. Coincidentally, this is a feature that Hugo has no intention of implementing, much to my chagrin. I believe this method, similarly to the Neocities CLI, goes through your folders and files alphabetically. This has rather annoying consequences for the automatic (and entirely unconfigurable) profile activity updates. It used to be that the last page you edited was the one that showed up as a primary thumbnail, but now it seems to be the first. This change is fairly recent. You can try to do tricksy things like changing Hugo front matter from draft: false to draft: true and vice versa while generating your public directory to achieve more granular control of the order your updates show up, but it sort of defeats the purpose of a one-click solution to just update your site. Updates are not instant, but my (very unscientific) measurement says that your site will reflect updates within a minute or less. It feels very efficient. I’m sure someone more knowledgable will know why, but alas, that is not me. Hopefully, this was at least somewhat helpful. I’m hardly an expert on GitHub, CLIs, or SSGs, so getting everything to work the way I wanted it to was (and still is!) often intimidating and unapproachable. I am the sort of person who needs lots of examples and hand-holding to feel confident in implementing something new (or, more typically, to mess it up over and over until I figure things out), so I thought it would make sense to write up the sort of guide I would have liked back then. Maybe then I wouldn’t have tried to upload my entire root directory to Neocities with the CLI…\nWell, anyways. Apologies for the trickle of site updates. I am actually moving yet again, and there’s so much to be done on this site that I often feel dizzy just thinking about it. Still, I plan to see it through to the very end. Hope you are all doing well.\nUPDATE (08/20/24): Something I’ve noticed about these tools and figure should be documented is that the CLI is much better at explaining the cause of errors. The GitHub Action just returns an error with fetching the API, but the CLI is very specific about why your site update failed. It’s how I discovered the (now fixed) filename character bug, in fact! So, I’d argue the CLI feels more reliable, if clunkier and less convenient.\n","description":"","tags":"tutorials","title":"Deploying Your Site to Neocities","uri":"/blog/post/deploy-site/"},{"content":"Hello, all. In case you haven’t heard yet, I made a webring! I’ve been curious about making one for awhile, but I wasn’t really sure what would interest people (who aren’t me). After asking Hors about her opinion on Hobonichi planners after a long stint as a bullet journaller (alleged), it occurred to me this might be a fun topic to build a webring around. (Despite the fact I still haven’t made my Nexus page that’s dedicated to journals. Which is going to happen eventually. I swear!)\nFor anyone uninitiated, a webring is a list of people. This list can be loosely organized around whatever you want. Each member of this list puts a snippet of code on their site, which generates a forward and backwards button based on that member’s position within the list. There’s typically a link back to the webring home page, and sometimes also a “Random” button to find new sites on the list. Sounds simple enough, yeah?\nKind of! There are a few considerations, including:\nThe webring code The webring widget The webring sign-up form (UPDATED) The webring homepage And these can all vary in complexity depending on your needs. For ease of navigation, I’ve split this post into these four sections so you can skip to read more about how JournalRing was created and to see if you might want to make your own webring! I made a lot of mistakes along the way, and I’ll be sure to talk a bit about those so you don’t have to make the same.\nI. The webring code There are a few webring scripts out there if you want to get started immediately. The most popular is probably onionring.js, but there are others, like RainRing and hatring.js. There’s also an interesting no-JS tutorial using Netlify here and another tutorial with a Netlify demo here. Neorings also offers a backend for webrings with a convenient directory.\nThese all have their own merits, but I thought it’d be best to just make my own. There were a few reasons for this, but it mostly boils down to none of them quite meeting all my needs and also being curious about what it’d be like to build a script on my own. Armed with this CSS tricks article and a dream, I persevered.\nThere were a few features I was dead-set on implementing:\nI wanted to store members’ data in JSON for legibility and ease of maintenance. This JSON list needed to be accessible enough for me to pull it to display the members list, update the member count, and scan the list for dead links. Each webring member should receive a single web component and JS link as to not be too verbose. The webring should accomodate multiple different styles of widgets without having to create entirely new JS files. Naturally, all of this had to be possible with zero back-end. This resulted in nenring (embedded below), which consists of two JS files – one to create the webring widget and store the membership information (nenring-config.js), and one to display the webring’s information (nenring-admin.js). In other words, one is for webring members, and one is for the admin. The admin will have to host both scripts, but only one of them is something webring members will reference within their take-home code. These files are blank, but I haven’t tested out these blank config files myself. If you want to see how I’ve actually implemented my JS, the notable files are in this folder.\nAs for how it actually works: A person signs up for my webring with a form. I am emailed when this happens so I can respond quickly. After checking their application and approving them, I add their information to the config.js file. I push this update, which then makes it so the widget will show up on their site. Then, I email them to inform them they’re approved. The admin.js file automatically adds their entry to my “Members” list and updates the Member count. If they ever delete their site, the console log will notify me so they can be removed.\nI’ve written a bit about web components in the past. Even though I ended up ditching my web components in favor of a static site generator after all, I still really enjoyed the idea of using web components for something like this. It just felt right–semantic, simple, easy to implement. The take-home code starts with some variation of \u003cjournal-ring icon=\"COLOR\"\u003e\u003c/journal-ring\u003e and then includes a link to the script. It does not get cleaner, in my opinion!\nA few things to note:\nI don’t love injecting the JSON directly into the JS file, but doing so allows you to bypass Cross-origin security policies. Other people on different domains trying to reference a JSON file on your site is a big no-no, it turns out. CORS policies are useful, but when you cannot control the server headers (like if you’re using Neocities) to allow cross-domain sharing, it can be a bit of a pain. The actual meat of this issue is a bit beyond the scope of this post, but you can read more about Cross-origin Request Sharing (CORS) here. There are workarounds, like proxies, but I figured I’d just put the data directly into the JS to avoid any drama.\nWhen you serve up your JS for people to take to their own site, you have to make sure the MIME type of the linked script matches the file extension. If you try and hotlink the raw file from Github, this won’t work. This is a feature, not a bug, I was just nearly 11 years late to hear about it. There are workarounds, the best of which is probably using a CDN like jsdelivr. You can also hotlink directly from your own website (which I was doing), but I don’t like how this locks you in to your domain. I’m a lot more likely to leave Neocities than I am to take my site off Github, so I recently (as in, like, yesterday) updated the take home widget to use a CDN link of my Github JS, which is super simple to do on Jsdeliver. If you already put the widget on your site with the hardcoded JS file served with Neocities, don’t worry, it’s probably fine. I don’t plan to leave Neocities anytime in the near future!\nThe nenring template files are intended to be used with a webring that has multiple widget themes that can be assigned a different color to differentiate them. For each different theme, you should have a widget icon link and icon image links for your forward and back buttons. It also is set up to accommodate a structure for a webring that uses name, website title, website url, and site description fields. If any of this is different from your intended usecase, you’ll have to modify the scripts to suit your needs.\nIf you try to automate scanning your JSON list for dead links, you’ll run into those pesky CORS errors again. Although I didn’t want to use a CORS proxy in the take-home JS for everyone, I figured it’s fine to do so in the actual admin file since it’s for your own personal use. I chose allOrigins because…it was the first one that actually worked. It’s possible this tool will become obsolete at some point–if it does, you’ll have to find a new one. I just really didn’t want to have to manually check everyone’s sites to make sure they’re still there.\nIf you want to log reachable sites in addition to dead links, you can change: .then(response =\u003e {\rif (!response.ok) {\rhandleDeadLink(member.url);\r}\r}) to\n.then(response =\u003e {\rif (response.ok) {\rconsole.log(`Link is reachable: ${member.url}`);\r} else {\rhandleDeadLink(member.url);\r}\r}) I mostly just removed the reachable sites bit with the thought that if someone has hundreds of sites listed, they’ll probably get annoyed pretty quickly. But if you like to see all sites (or even just to check that it works), you can do this.\nII. The webring widget My original plan for JournalRing was to create a Hobonichi widget, a Leuchtturm/Moleskin widget, a Mead widget, a Traveler’s notebook widget, and a spiral bound notebook widget. I even made little doodles of what they were going to look like. I started with the Hobonichi widget, promptly realized how difficult pixel art is, and very rapidly abandoned the thought. Instead, I ended up making different colors for the Hobonichi widget. A stylish compromise if I say so myself.\nTo this end, I primarily used Libresprite, a free and open source fork of the better known Aseprite.\nI’ve been meaning to make a more in-depth post about Libresprite as part of my FOSS recommendations series. I used it to make my website button and found the experience overall very nice! I haven’t used Aseprite for comparison, but I haven’t found any features lacking in Libresprite that feel like a deal-breaker. That said, I’m pretty much a pixel art n00b, as it were.\nAnyways, Libresprite has overlay layers, but I’m so used to Clip Studio Paint’s that I tossed in the pixels there for final processing. Not quite as FOSS, but what can I say. I’m a creature of habit. I tweaked some of the colors to get different shades for the widgets. Once the widget colors were finalized, I made a forward and back button to match. I tried to get away with just using text arrows, but it didn’t have the same pizzazz.\nHonestly, in retrospect, I wish I’d made the journal widgets look more like stickers to match the journal thing I have going on. But I have even less experience making stickers than I do making pixel art, so maybe once I have a little more experience. If I ever do update the links to the widget icons in the code, it will end up updating on everyone’s page, which is an unsettling amount of power. Theoretically, you could link it to whatever you wanted, even Sasuke doing a Fortnite dance.\nI swear if I ever update the widgets, they will be cute enough to justify it. I think they look fine as is, but I still don’t have much pixel art wisdom to share. Make sure it looks good small!\nIII. The webring sign-up form Not much of a webring if it’s just you. You’ll want to set up a form. You cannot do this natively with a static site. But don’t fear…there are bountiful options if you have a static site. You can also use this if you don’t have a static site, but just don’t want to deal with the backend. Up to you!\nFormspree.io: This is what I originally used for JournalRing, and I was very happy with how simple it is to set up (even if you only get 50 submissions per month on their free tier, which is half of some of the other offerings). Formspree is simple because it’s just a backend for form management, which means you can style it however you want. Be aware you can’t have file uploads on their free plan (like a site button), but you can have people input a link to files if you want a workaround. I did have some issues though. FormKeep: I now use FormKeep for JournalRing instead of Formspree. Read the update below for more information. Essentially, it has most of the features Formspree does (note: this means submissions per month are capped at 50), with the exception of real time notifications when you get a submission. You can get daily summaries instead, which works fine for my purposes. It’s also very user friendly–it has an intuitive, comprehensible UI, they developed a linter to check your HTML forms for best practices, and have support for creating a blank honeypot field to better protect yourself from spam. You can use it as a form builder or as a backend for form management. Netlify: If you use Netlify to deploy your site, you should be aware that it ships with forms! There are limited submissions on their free tier (100 per month), but that’s more than enough for small projects like this (and double what Formspree allows). Tally.so: Tally.so is pretty cool and fairly customizable for a form generator. You embed the code of the form into your site, and you can’t just use it as a backend like Jotform (and so there’s more limited customizability). But you can also embed forms with file uploads pretty easily. Airtable: I haven’t used Airtable that extensively, so I can’t really speak to its benefits, but I have seen some webrings that are using it. So I know it’s a thing! It honestly looks a little intimidating to me though. Google Forms: Note: you cannot embed a Google form if it also has a file upload. That said, it does the trick if you don’t want to sign up anywhere and just want responses delivered to your inbox. Jotform: Another popular WYSIWYG form builder, I believe one of the first. You can get 100 submissions per month on their free tier. Regardless of which of these options you choose, if you use nenring, you’ll either want to stick with the preset fields (name, url, website title, website description, and email for contact) or modify the code to allow for things like a site button.\nIf you do want to use Formspree, here is basically how I implemented it. You can view the SCSS file for my form styling as well (it’s pretty simple!)\n\u003cform action=\"https://formspree.io/f/{form_id}\" method=\"POST\"\u003e\r\u003cinput type=\"text\" id=\"name\" name=\"name\" required placeholder=\"Name\"\u003e\r\u003cinput type=\"email\" id=\"email\" name=\"email\" required placeholder=\"Email (for contact only)\"\u003e\r\u003cinput type=\"text\" id=\"website_title\" name=\"website_title\" required placeholder=\"Website Title\"\u003e\r\u003cinput type=\"url\" id=\"website_url\" name=\"website_url\" required placeholder=\"Website URL\"\u003e\r\u003ctextarea id=\"description\" name=\"description\" rows=\"4\" required placeholder=\"Website Description\"\u003e\u003c/textarea\u003e\r\u003cbutton type=\"submit\"\u003eSubmit\u003c/button\u003e\r\u003c/form\u003e UPDATE (3/28/24) Okay, so I actually meant to update this post earlier, but just haven’t gotten around to it. Anyways, I ended up switching from Formspree to FormKeep. Basically, Formspree had a significant problem in my case–I’m not sure why, but it was flagging well over half of the submissions to JournalRing as spam without notifying me. So, when I realized this, I simply turned off spam detection. Which was fine for a few days…until I got randomly flooded with spam so severe that Formspree locked my account. I emailed them to get it unlocked (twice), but never heard anything back. To prevent excessive downtime, I tried out Web3Forms, but…they don’t allow their service on Neocities domains (you’d think they’d put that in the docs!) due to spam issues.\nSo, then, I moved to FormKeep. The code is basically the same. The only difference is I added a honeypot field (per their suggestion), which is basically just a hidden field that’s meant to trick bots into proving they’re not human. It’s also very easy to implement. Essentially, you copy and paste the value they give you under the “Spam” section of the broader “Form Settings” header and add something to your form like this:\n\u003cinput type=\"text\" name=\"HONEYPOT_VALUE\" style=\"display:none\"\u003e\nSo far, so good, and I’m happy with it. Just thought I’d update this blog post and make sure everyone has the best information I can offer.\nIV. The webring homepage I thought, hey, wouldn’t it be so cute to make a layout that emulates a journal?! With a highlighter, realistic pages, and journal tabs? So I nabbed a photo of the Dreamy Soda case from the Hobonichi Techo website and threw it into Photoshop to fix up. Then, I hunted down some graph paper to overlay on top of that picture, and voila!\nWell, sort of. I still had to do the actual coding part, and I hadn’t thought all that far ahead. I just knew I really wanted to avoid using px with absolute positioning. I have a weird vendetta against px. Not very old-web of me, I know, but I wanted the journal container to behave more responsively, resizing to match the viewport at any size. This ended up being a pretty big challenge because what I fundamentally wanted was to mix responsive styling with non-responsive functioning and to break the zoom function, which was a bit…messy. The sloppy code is most noticeable with the stickers, which I will re-tool to be more code efficient someday. To make things mobile responsive, I just flipped everything 90 degrees to force a psuedo-landscape mode and called it a day (another good idea courtesy of Hors).\nI think it looks pretty good on most displays, except for whatever bizarre aspect ratio the Neocities screenshot tool uses to capture website updates. It looks like an atypical tablet-esque size? Whatever, it looks fine once I open it on most displays, which is good enough for me!\nYou can look at the SCSS folder on Github. If that’s too confusing, just know it can be broken down by the main SCSS, and then the extra SCSS snippets which can be found here. Fun fact: the body font has to use vw (view width) units to make any of this work.\nI initially set up my first spread with CSS page counters, but after implementing the journal tabs, I realized that they wouldn’t count properly. Fundamentally, all the content on the JournalRing homepage is contained within one HTML file, specific sections for the left and right pages are just conditionally displayed or hidden depending on which tab is selected. Which confuses CSS counters. So I ended up just appending a page number to the headers with Javascript.\nI also wanted my “Members” list to resemble an address book, with pre-printed boxes to fill in. This was a little more complex than I expected because I separated the “left” and “right” pages (meaning that I had to define how many placeholder boxes should be there per page). Also, once there are more than 10 entries, there’ll be previous and next buttons under the 10th entry, but I thought it’d look strange to have them before then. Just generally a lot more JS logic than I’d been anticipating!\nBecause of how the journalring display script was developed, I ended up having to later extract the relevant script for people-who-aren’t-me and turn it into the nenring-admin.js script. You can find the full layout js, including how I pulled the data from the other file, here.\nA big thing I discovered while attempting to access the membership data contained in the journalring.js file is that you should load both scripts on the same page, and you must load the file containing the members first. Additionally, you have to attach the JSON list to the window object. This works because if both JS files are used on the same page, they can both access the window object. So if you attach the JSON list to a window object and then load it alongside a script meant to pull that data, that other script can call it with something like window.membersData; This is outlined within the nenring code comments, but it was important enough that I think it deserves its own paragraph.\nConclusion This was fun despite it all! I walked into the project expecting it to be difficult, but I wasn’t expecting some of the roadblocks I hit along the way. I appreciate everyone’s patience as I discovered crazy things about raw Github file MIME types, CORS errors, and window objects. I wanted to make sure things got ironed out before I released this blog post, but I still haven’t done a fresh test of nenring, so use at your discretion and please do report any weirdness. I also don’t know how clear this post is, apologies. I haven’t proofread it all that much, and it was kind of written in one go. So if you have any questions, you’re free to comment or email me. I hope I didn’t leave anything too big out.\nI think webrings are one of the most fun aspects of the “smallweb,” so I highly encourage more people to make webrings. I’m already thinking of making more…a yume webring would be fun, or maybe a shoujo one, or a marine biology one…who knows! Leave suggestions if you want, or go ahead and get started making your own. Good luck!\n","description":"","tags":"tutorials","title":"Making a Webring: The Creation of JournalRing","uri":"/blog/post/journalring/"},{"content":"","description":"","tags":null,"title":"JournalRing","uri":"/webrings/journalring/"},{"content":"Wow! It’s been awhile. I apologize for how long it’s been. To tell you the truth, this site got a lot more ambitious than I ever meant for it to. I definitely bit off more than I could chew, and when that happens, I tend to avoid the project until I can get no-lifer obsessed with it.\nWell it happened! I got no-lifer obsessed and now there are many new things going on.\nBlog Updates: A long-term struggle I’ve had is figuring out how to integrate native Hugo taxonomies with JS libraries that handle filtering. As a bandaid solution, I created a /tags/ page to host all tagged blog posts, and so each had its own page (ie: /tagged/personal). Which is very Tumblr-esque and not inherently bad, but I disliked that it functioned so much differently from the rest of the site. No more! The blog is now one page without 3 separate tag pages to maintain (and so this should make Neocities updates a lot less tedious also…when will we be allowed to set our own previews btw?) Another thing that was much easier than I realized was conditional thumbnails. I didn’t want to commit to every single post having an image, but always assumed this would be super hard. It’s not. Literally all you need to do is put this in your HTML: {{ if .Params.thumbnail }} \u003cimg class=\"thumbnail\" src=\"{{ .Params.thumbnail }}\" alt=\"Thumbnail Image\"\u003e {{ end }} and throw a thumbnail parameter in the front matter for posts you want an image for. I’m seriously so bad at comprehending documentation. I also think I want to make alt text a parameter that can be updated, but I think making this site more accessible will be its own wild project, so I will table that for another time… Search Updates: Really not too much much to say here. Using Lunr.js, I finally got the search feature working! Third time’s the charm, as they say. Plus I asked ChatGPT to debug my janky Javascript. Font Updates: You may notice that the fonts are pretty different! I swapped out every single font that I did not have a commercial license for and/or was not 100% free. Fly high Porkys. You will be missed. This was surprisingly time consuming. It turns out I am not an easy woman to please when it comes to typography. But I’m actually very fond of my selections. The fonts I’m using for headers are Distro (Heavy) (free), Franxurter Totally Fat (free), Kirom (paid), and Pixel Gamer (paid). Shout out to my mother for letting me hijack her Envato Elements account! I suppose this is as good a place as any to shoehorn in the announcement that I do plan to open web development commissions pretty soon. I think I’ll do simple one-pagers, and I’m not sure how much I want to charge, but I think it’ll probably go over better than digital art commissions? Or not. I’m not fully decided yet. If you want to weigh in, feel free to do so in the comments. But since that changes the scope of this site from personal to squarely commercial, I do want to cross my t’s and dot my i’s. Plus, it’s nice to change things up sometimes! Microblog Updates: Well, update, singular, I guess. This is a huge win for me because it was just extremely annoying to fix, but it is. It should now definitively load BEFORE the grid and prevent any overlapping. You have no idea how happy this makes me. But, just to stretch out this section: I’ve been thinking about updating my microblog CSS for awhile and posting my old CSS on the code page. I think it’d be fun to share skins for Hat’s super wonderful RSS microblog script to psyop more people into using it. Behind the Scenes Updates: This probably isn’t relevant to anyone but me, but I also finally fulfilled a long-term dream and played around with Hugo Pipes to transpile SASS to CSS. My CSS files were abominations. Crimes against humanity. I love bite sized file chunks and I’ve long admired the elegance of SASS nesting! And so I have taken it for myself. Whether this will work smoothly enough to actually deploy to Neocities without disaster remains to be seen, but I choose to believe everything will be fine–for my own sanity! Someday, I’d like to revamp the SASS/CSS further to add color maps for theme switching (something like this), but I got started, realized how much work it’d be, and decided to table it for another day when I’m feeling masochistic. Speaking of CSS stuff, I also have updated some of the font handling and card sizing CSS. I’m using clamp now, which I’m admittedly still getting the hang of. If anything looks weird on your display, please let me know! Misc Updates I’ve hidden a few blog posts, and will probably update the site to clean it up a bit over the next few weeks. I’m working on a Professional Portfolio Website for web/graphic design stuff, and I think it’d be a huge loss to not include this website after all the work I’ve put into it. It’s also been an incredible learning experience for me. But it’s also not super professional at the moment–to an extent, that’s fine, but I do want to make it a little more presentable for display. And as a final note, I want to make a smaller, more private diary website to actually just be as unprofessional as I want to be. I want to get started on that site sometime this month. I’ll probably host it on Neocities. If you want the URL…perhaps email me? I’m going to make it public facing most likely, I don’t plan to say anything crazy, I just want to create a small separation here. And I’ll try to keep the scope of that site limited, lest I invest so much into it I get tempted to put it on another portfolio. OH, also–thinking about adding new themes sometime. Are there any themes/color schemes you’d all be interested in? Let me know if you do! Final thing–you guys hatched my Tamanotchi!! Thank you so much. Okay, is that everything? Honestly, it felt like more. Going to go wrestle with Hugo and Neocities some more to make sure this actually gets posted the way I want it to. It’s very likely this blog post will be buried underneath all the other pages getting updated, but if so, I’ll just post a link on my feed.\nI’ve missed you all! Talk to you soon. Hope everyone has been doing well.\n","description":"","tags":"site updates","title":"Mega Site Update","uri":"/blog/post/mega-site-update/"},{"content":" UPDATE (12/28/24): Meant to update this post sooner, but a Firefox update broke some of the CSS styling in the original post (specifically, the hover functionality and the toolbar positioning). I’ve updated the Gist from Step 3 to fix it, but wanted to add this notice here in case anyone is revisiting the post. I probably won’t keep up with these sorts of errors in the future (or will be slow to fix them) because I have since moved to Zen Browser, a Firefox fork that natively supports (almost) everything outlined in this post without having to use custom CSS. The only thing it does not support is nested tabs, which is on the roadmap for a future release.\nThis is the first installment of my “FOSS recommendations” series (or something.) It started off as a single post, but I ended up having so much to say about each recommendation that I decided they’d be better off with their own dedicated posts.\nFirst on the list, of course, is Mozilla Firefox, an internet browser you’ve probably heard of. It is widely beloved for its consideration of user privacy and customization, earning it a loyal fanbase. Although its privacy settings are very configurable out of the box, the more staunchly data-protective user might prefer Librewolf, a privacy-oriented Firefox fork.\nAs for customization, you can directly edit the browser CSS to make it look however you want. Firefox has also introduced tools like Firefox Color to allow you to easily modify your color scheme. There are also a plethora of add-ons for Firefox, many of which allow for CSS tweaking.\nHere’s a demo of my current Firefox setup:\nI’ve achieved this look with some CSS and a few add-ons. My setup features:\nA collapsible sidebar (expands on hover) An active/inactive tab counter that functions as a new tab button Italicized inactive/unread tabs Clickable favicon to expand/collapse tab tree Hover to see what tab number you’re on Tab titles and close button disappear when sidebar is collapsed Top (horizontal) tabs are hidden in favor of tree tabs Window control buttons (minimize, maximize, close) are merged with the toolbar Active tab highlight color is selected from your Firefox theme Purple/pink color scheme If you’re a tab addict who cares deeply about screen real estate, continue reading for instructions on how to recreate my setup! This tutorial presumes you’ve already downloaded Firefox.\nStep 1: Customize Firefox Color Get the Firefox Color extension. Head to the website. Select whatever theme you want. Or make your own. You can also use mine, a slightly modified version of a pre-existing theme. Step 2: Get tree (vertical) tabs Download Piro’s Tree Style Tab add-on. From your add-on list, you can right click and select “Manage extension”. Click the tab that says “Preferences”. Select the Photon theme. The Proton theme will also work. Scroll down and reveal the “Advanced” options. Copy and paste the following Gist code into the code box. Note that your vertical tab text might vanish. Don’t worry about it! We’ll deal with the collapsing sidebar in step 3. Note: Most of the changes I’ve made here are pulled from this Github page full of tweaks. Step 3: Access your Firefox CSS In the taskbar, type about:config, press enter, and accept the risk. Copy and paste toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets in the searchbar. Make sure it’s set to true. If not, click it twice. Type about:profiles in the taskbar and press enter. Under “Profile: default-release” (your default profile), locate the “Root Directory” tab and click “Open Directory”. Create a folder called “chrome”. Create a file within that folder called userChrome.css Copy and paste the following Gist into the code box. Restart Firefox to see changes. *Note that line 14 may require you to make alterations based on your viewport. Step 4: Customizing Tabliss For my new tab page, I use a FOSS add-on called Tabliss. Grab it for yourself! Tabliss lets you fine-tune what backgrounds you want to display. They use the Unsplash API to allow you to select custom collections of photographs (along many other options). I made my own collection here, which you can reference in the Tabliss background settings by adding “_zqqJaaI4YQ” under “Collection.” You should add similar widgets, such as “Quick Links,” “Search,” and “Greeting”. After you’re done, select a new widget for “Custom CSS” and add this snippet. It adds Fira Sans, a translucent background box for the center, and modifies the search bar a bit. @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Fira+Sans\u0026display=swap'); .Slot.middleCentre { background-color: rgba(90, 0, 90, 0.75); /* can change this */ border-radius: 5px; border: 1px solid; padding: 3em; } .Search input{ border: 0; font-size:0.8em; outline:1px solid; border-radius: 5px; padding:0.5em; } Congrats, you are me! If all has gone well, your browser should look very cool and sexy like so:\n","description":"","tags":["tutorials","recs"],"title":"Firefox Tree Tabs Tu(tour)ial","uri":"/blog/post/firefox-tutourial/"},{"content":"As I have mentioned more than once on this site, I am moving, at least for a little while. This decision was made back in October, and ever since, we have been moving at a glacial pace. We sent our belongings overseas back in Februray, so I’ve been operating with maybe 30% of my belongings ever since. Pretty nuts!\nThe circumstances of the move are…not ideal, to leave it vague, and has been more out of necessity than anything, so everyone has been dragging their feet. Still, it looks like we truly will be leaving at the end of the month, and so, naturally, my mother and I held a garage sale today.\nIt was slow honestly, we didn’t sell all that much. But it was still interesting talking to the people who visited. Some were definitely hoarders who got up bright and early to do thrilling things like haggle down the price of a $2 candle, which is tedious at the best of times and downright excruciating before noon. But there were also lots of families and intersting people just looking for weird niche stuff, and that was nice.\nThis one guy with an aspirational Youtube son asked to buy the Gorillaz shirt I was wearing. I was taken off guard and told him it’s a very old shirt, one I’ve had since I was 13 and still shopped at Hot Topic. He emphatically explained that was why it was such a novelty–this was their best era, after all, but Demon Days shirts were few and far between! I felt a little bad telling him no, but Noodle and I are sticking together to the end.\nA different family bought my matching set of human and pet pajamas, which I’d used for thrilling Christmas photos with my cat before. I’m moving somewhere too hot to justify the warm PJs, and my cat has always loathed her outfit (sad since she looks so cute), so despite the heartache, I parted with it. I was overjoyed to discover that the little boy who selected these matching outfits intended to match with his pet rabbit. I wonder if the outfit will fit the rabbit?\nI took a few pictures of things for sale that I’m attached to (albums, stuffed animals, clothes, books, trinkets), and I think I might try to turn them into PNGs and make a “shrine” (renamed to “Nexus” btw) of the items with little descriptions. Problem is I have so many pages in progress…\nAnyways, after the sale was over, I packed what was leftover in the car and resolved to donate the rest tomorrow. Then I made a grilled ham, cheese, and arugula sandwich with garlic butter. It was pretty good, but I think it could be greatly improved. Next time!\nI was pretty tired, but determined not to take a late afternoon nap and destroy my sleep schedule again, I took a shower. By the time I got out, it was raining…it’s been raining a lot more than usual here lately, which is awful for my productivity since it makes me want to get all cozy in bed.\nSpeaking of which, due to some mattress musical chairs, I somehow ended up with two flimsy twins stacked on top of one another, which is a horrible nightmare state of affairs. They constantly slid away from each other and I’d fall off in the middle of the night. This was the status quo for months!\nNo longer! We got a mattress (which was so much drama it’d require another post…) that is far more respectable, so I decided to set that up for tomorrow’s inevitable rain induced nap.\nIt’s…comically tall? But comfortable, so it’s fine!\nTossed all my linens in the wash to give myself the optimal first night after all this turmoil. Now everything is in the dryer and I’m taking a smoke/blog break.\nLet’s see, what else…I guess I could review the site updates (there are many, most of them pretty small, but you’ve probably already noticed the navigation bar swapping places), but I don’t really feel like it! Ctrl + f5 if anything looks off. There’ll be more updates in a CSS post I’m planning…eventually.\nI leave you all with this song in honor of the Noodle Shirt Incident.\n","description":"","tags":"personal","title":"Yard Sale","uri":"/blog/post/yard-sale/"},{"content":"This post is a site update wrapped up in a diary entry, so I’ll start off with a quick rundown of those updates:\nNew start menu New sitemap No more Bootstrap! (lots of style changes, ctrl f5 if anything is off) Still so much left to do, but I’m trying not to put too much pressure on myself. This might be my last major update for awhile (although I have a few planned shrines \u0026 posts which might make it out before all is said and done). My Windows laptop (primary) restarted 14 times in the last 24 hours, which is about as fun as it sounds. Still working on transferring all my shit to an older laptop, but yeah, things are just in flux.\nIt was whilst anxiously procrastinating moving stuff that I started randomly scraping at the Bootstrap on my site like burnt egg on a nonstick pan, and before I knew it, it turned into a whole thing. Had to comb through all my code for the fourth time, and although I’m pretty tired, look, new start menu!\nI’d previously been using Bootstrap’s JS modal to handle the start menu, but I learned more about vanilla modals when I was working on the Sakura page theme and decided to implement it myself.\nBut I’m getting ahead of myself.\nFor those unaware, Bootstrap is a front-end library–arguably the most popular of its kind–that you can drop into your website for extremely quick, basic styling. Without touching a single line of CSS or JS yourself, you can design a serviceable website.\nAnd many, many, many do. Bootstrap’s simplicity means that it’s the first recommendation to novice web developers who are intimidated by or disinterested in CSS. Thus, a sort of digital sameface has emerged, a visual homogenization of the internet. A website that is relying on Bootstrap for its design is immediately identifiable, even if you don’t realize you know what I’m talking about. Peruse through some of these examples, and you’ll get the idea.\nHotly debated and ever-controversial amongst front-end web developers, I’ve often felt defensive over allegations of how Bootstrap is destroying web design. Although Boostrap is fairly opinionated in its design language, you can always override its default styling, after all. Besides, I’d tell myself, I use Bootstrap for its grid system, not its styling.\nYou see, I also have strong opinions about design, so I’ve often butted heads with Bootstrap. I also have a deep affection for Bootstrap because it saved my ass when I had no idea what I was doing (Cicadagate).\nThe thing about CSS is that it’s super easy to get started with, but it’s not easy to actually master, and you often think you know way more than you actually do. Tools like Bootstrap are excellent at compensating for these weaknesses–in my case, I was (and am) generally weak with grids and flex. This translated to weakness with responsive CSS and layouts, which made it very difficult to achieve my specific design goals.\nThis isn’t totally my fault; CSS grid wasn’t fully adopted until 2017 and flexbox didn’t get cross-browser support until 2014. This stuff is constantly evolving! And I realize that I, too, must evolve. Frankly, there’s no real reason to use Bootstrap now that there are better tools. Back when I first used it, it was an emergency situation, and although I’m grateful, it got me into bad habits and let me stagnate.\nOn top of what it was costing me in my learning, it was also costing my site performance. Dependencies slow your site down, and something as robust as Bootstrap that loads in the \u003chead\u003e tag (meaning it has to load before the rest of your site will) can cause a noticeable performance hit. I’m already using a lot more Javascript than I meant to, so I don’t want to slow my site down even more!\nEspecially because, well, I was not using it for its design functions. I was primarily using it for its column system (which really is quite useful, and has taught me a lot about what I want from boilerplate CSS), which is achievable without Bootstrap, if a bit more annoying.\nI ended up making a general purpose .row flex class and then adding utility classes for different row alignments (center, space-between, space-evenly, etc.) to maintain some of my row construction. I also created a general .grid that auto-fills space and added a few utility classes for column sizing. This got me a long way, but there were still various annoyances.\nHappy to say my HTML is much cleaner now that I’m separating concerns more clearly, which often means less repetition. Although I’m still using utility classes, much more CSS is where it belongs…in the stylesheet, that is.\nWhile I was already in there digging around, I went ahead and changed all the window sizing from responsive units to pixel units (which makes it more responsive in some ways, less responsive in others.) Example: Gallery used to be locked into 4 columns, now it’ll shrink to 3 at a certain size. I’m still not happy with all of the shrinking behavior, but let’s put that on a list of things to do…some other time. I’ll put it right under fixing the search function, which I’ve tried and failed to resolve twice now. JS experts hit me up whenever lol.\nI did end up making a sitemap–it’s a modified version of this nested menu add-on for Hugo. I couldn’t find anything that did exactly what I want, and as I am still very intimidated by Go, this will do for now. I really love how powerful Hugo is. I will do my best to learn more and more…\nAnyways, my mother cut my hair because it was getting unwieldy. I thought this was greatly symbolic in light of my breakup with Bootstrap.\nFarewell, friend!\n","description":"","tags":"site updates","title":"Bye-bye Bootstrap","uri":"/blog/post/bye-bye-bootstrap/"},{"content":"Hey, what’s up. I haven’t made a blog post in awhile, mostly because the microblog exists as a more convenient place for me to dump my half-baked thoughts, and also because I haven’t finished any of the actual guides or posts that I want to post here (sorry).\nSo this is more of a diary entry reflecting on some stuff I’ve noticed while being on Neocities. It’s been a little over two months since I started this site, and I still have such a long way to go (keep an eye out for new shrines soon btw…), but I’m really happy with how much I’ve learned so far. I’m excited to continue moving forward with Neocities, but I do have some observations about the community element of it, and about online communities (Discord, Tumblr, Twitter, etc.) in general.\nOld web nostalgia I’ve noticed a ton of old web nostalgia, which I guess is to be expected on a platform modelled after Geocities. I also have a healthy dose of nostalgia for old forum aesthetics and table-based layouts, but I do think some people take it a little far.\nI’m 26 and I’m still too young to treat dial-up and AOL messenger as if it was ever a major part my life. Web 1.0 ended around 2005, when I was still in elementary school, and I’m older than a lot of users here. What little I do recall of the old web is a mixed bag–I remember excruciating wait times for webpages, obvious adults on Neopets trying to lure kids into private chatrooms, and just an overall lack of organization and cohesion. There was also a lot to love, but I don’t know if it really benefits anyone to pine for an aestheticized and frankly fictionalized phase of internet culture that will never exist again. It was wild and untamed because it was brand new, and there’s no way to re-capture the novelty of the late 90s/early 2000s internet.\nHonestly, I think it’s more about re-experiencing childhood for a lot of people than anything else. And I don’t think that’s wrong or anything, I just find the justifications for this nostalgia strange. Like, why do you have to pretend the Kid Pix widget on your site is political resistance against corporate internet when we both know it’s just because it makes you feel warm and fuzzy to remember simpler times? It’s okay to be self-indulgent on your personal website! I’m not sure why it has to be more than that. Which isn’t to say you can’t have fun and try to make a statement, it just sometimes feels like people don’t realize they’re allowed to enjoy things for the sake of it.\nAnd for a lot of people who are definitely too young to have experienced it, I dunno, it’s weird. It’s like teenagers projecting the politics they imagine Web 1.0 held and prescribing a set of aesthetics to those politics. I think it’s generally a bad idea to treat ideology like fashion, but I think social media has done a lot to normalize this practice.\nWhich leads me into my next observation…\nPolitics in online communities I think we messed up by insisting to ourselves and each other that Gen Z is somehow ontologically woke. Many, many young people online have deeply conservative impulses that they’ve never questioned. Ever notice how it’s always the people with “be gay do crime” in their bios who get mad at you for pirating their blorbos? The state of political consciousness is so grim that the people siding with Disney on stricter copyright laws think they’re anti-capitalists.\nIt also doesn’t escape me that a lot of the politics people ascribe to the old web are just…entirely fabricated. For example, this whole “don’t steal my code” thing I keep seeing is almost always coming from the exact same people who wax nostalgic for the old web. Girl! If you scold people over CSS theft, you would not have lasted a day on the actual old web. You are “good old days\"ing something that never even existed! Besides, one of the best things about the old web was how collaborative it was. Frantic possessiveness over HTML and CSS is antithetical to the ethos of the old web.\nPerhaps it’s inevitable that when you create a social dynamic where people are expected to immediately have an opinion about everything, they’ll base those opinions on vibes (read: social conditioning) rather than theory, data, or logic. This is also why you constantly see openly conservative politics paraded all over social media as if it’s novel or brave. If someone has no ideological base, it’s easy to convince them something is radical as long as you use the right framing. But if you scratch off the coat of progressive paint, it’s abundantly obvious that scorching hot takes like “let women wear makeup” are, in fact, neutered and useless. If your politics are all just pithy, nonthreatening slogans a CNN pundit might tweet, your politics are necessarily not-radical and probably actually strengthening repressive, hegemonic narratives.\nThis isn’t just an issue on Neocities; it’s become the status quo for political discourse online. So I did expect it to some degree, but I think I was overly optimistic. I guess I thought that a platform like this would be more “here’s some Linux guides and FOSS recommendations” and less “you’re a fascist if you don’t think heteroromantic asexuals are queer” microblogger discourse. It is surreal to see people continuously re-litigating 2014 Tumblr discourse. I recognize so many of the common talking points online because I was there when that discourse was born, and I am still here now that discourse’s bloated corpse has washed back up to shore. I wish we’d let it rest. Most of it was stupid infighting among bored teenagers then, and it still is now.\nThe truth is you’re supposed to grow up and find real things to care about, not triple down on the apparent life-or-death seriousness of fanfiction politics or whatever. Which isn’t to say you can’t get into some inane, petty discourse as a treat (I do this), but I think you have to keep it in perspective. Could you explain this topic to an offline person without a 3 hour YouTube essay? No? Then it’s probably too insular and niche to justify the energy you’re putting into arguing about it.\nThe promise of community I am constantly falling into a trap. I think the concept of community is so fantastic that I continuously search for it on every platform, and I am continuously disappointed when the reality doesn’t meet my expectations. There is a certain community on Neocities that recently shut down. I never partook in it, but I was hoping for its success, and reading the moratorium has been a bit disheartening.\nMaybe this is just the byproduct of an increasingly polarized internet, but it feels like people are getting worse and worse with boundaries. It seems some aren’t content with setting boundaries for themselves–they want to set yours, too. Extremely online spaces always seem to devolve into masses of paranoid people policing each other. I mean the type of people who’ll emotionally blackmail you into walking on eggshells, who’ll tell you what you’re allowed to watch and read, who you’re allowed to speak to and associate with, and what thoughts you’re allowed to think. All this while totally convinced they’re moral paragons.\nI recently saw a post on Tumblr that essentially said we need to learn how to simply dislike people without manufacturing a moral justification. It had nearly 100,000 notes; tons of people were acting like this was some long overdue revelation, and I find that unnerving. Very bleak when we need a post to explain that your personal dislike of someone doesn’t make them evil!\nI can admit I used to fall into this tribal thinking, but it’s a miserable way to live, and I saw people get torn apart by their online peers for things that would’ve been total non-issues just a year later. When you create a category of person it’s morally justified to destroy, you create an incentive to put anyone you dislike in that category. This is especially true for people who are bullies to their core but desperately need to maintain moral superiority.\nI’m not saying you should tolerate anyone. I think it’s necessary to set boundaries. But I also think that this weird, entitled vigilance people exhibit goes way beyond that. Once you start publicly shaming random no-name people for their associations rather than just blocking and moving on, you turn into a sanctimonious little hall monitor in my eyes and I am deeply skeptical of your motivations.\nI have seen the justification for this sort of behavior being, “the small web is about curating your own space, we shouldn’t allow (xyz).” First off, who is ‘we’? When did I agree to this? Second, who said that’s what the small web is about? Where is this memo? Third, if the small web is about curating your space, why are you trying to tell other people how to curate theirs? Who even decides what constitutes the ‘small web’ to begin with? What is your goal here?\nI absolutely refuse to engage in this sort of triablism anymore, but it seems that’s all that’s available these days. There’s no community, just self-cannibalizing cliques. Very sad!\nI think I’ll wrap up this post here, but in the interest of cultivating community, DO please consider sending me an email if you: are an eldest daughter, are a Haruki Murakami hater, have strong opinions about betta fish, are skeptical that dinosaurs were real, have been accused of being pretentious by someone who exclusively reads YA fiction, are a woman with moderate to severe scoliosis, step on sidewalk cracks with purpose, or have ever earnestly cast a spell on someone.\nSee you next time!\n","description":"","tags":"personal","title":"2 months later: A Neocities Reflection","uri":"/blog/post/neocities-reflection/"},{"content":"TLDR: There is now a library of various types of media (from books to video). It’s listed in the Start Menu and on the Index page now. The shrines page finally looks presentable. There’s still just…well, Cole. For now. Now part of the null webring, which is viewable on the links page. Changed out the body font for the “black” theme. I think it looks nicer now. BLOG POST: I love libraries.\nWhen I was a child, my local library held all sorts of events. I have warm memories of summer reading challenges, overnight reading lock-ins, and Ghibli movie nights hosted on a small, bulky TV we’d all crowd around. Off-brand dark cola and cheese pizza still remind me of late nights reading, the thrill of being a child in a library at 3AM curled up with a Lois Duncan book.\nIn elementary school, I often spent recess in the school library, flopped over a bean bag as I worked my way through books methodically. I would set goals for myself (“I will read this entire shelf”) and proudly proclaim them to the librarian, inventing tracking sheets and hunting for challengers to compete with. (Surprisingly, this was not an especially effective recruiting tactic.)\nWhen I started struggling with mental health issues in 7th grade, I’d often retreat to the school library to calm myself down. The school librarians, eventually coaxing out the details, invented a “librarian assistant” position just for me, complete with a “librarian pass” that allowed me to leave class whenever I wanted. I also got a special clipboard to survey classmates on what books to order. I’d often sneak in a few extra orders of my favorite shoujo manga while the head librarian shared homemade sugar cookies with me.\nIn high school, I spent so much time in the library that they gave me admin privileges. I used to have a bad habit of dropping by on my way to the bus stop at the end of the day to get another book, and I’d invariably get so distracted I missed the bus. A girl I liked approached me to be friends, so naturally, I invited her to the library, a proposal her mom found so confusing she called my mom.\nIn college, I flirted with food service before remembering I, well, love libraries. So then I spent four years working in libraries on two different campuses. I worked in Digital Collections archiving and OCR’ing fragile documents, then after I moved to a new school, started working in in Archives \u0026 Special Collections. After awhile, I ended up with a dual position in the Digital Services department, splitting my summers into collecting archival materials and then later scanning and uploading those materials. And truly, I loved it.\nThen I graduated.\nDue to a few Reasons, I can’t go to the public library all that often anymore. I also don’t have the academic credentials to access to databases anymore, which has been pretty devastating. (At least JSTOR still lets you check out 100 articles a month?) Anyways, I miss the library.\nIt’s scarily easy to just stop reading. In fact, after a few years of not really reading much, it got harder and harder to get back into it. And maybe I’m just being dramatic, but I realized that for me, a life comprised of just fandom-y content and goofing off is incomprehensibly miserable. So I decided I needed to start reading again.\nAnd now I’ve decided to share some of the stuff I’ve read with you, dear reader…for free! Partly because I think it’s cool to have a webpage of stuff I’ve found illuminating, partly because I think open access to information is important, and partly because I think it’s easier to read things when someone plops it down in front of you, and I think we could all probably stand to read more. I only found a ton of stuff on that list because of random bloggers posting snippets, so hopefully something there is useful to someone.\nI’ve spent the past few days setting up the library, and I think it’s a nice start. I won’t pretend to remember the ins-and-outs of every title (hey, it’s been a long time, okay), but I know many of my beliefs have been informed, changed, and/or otherwise challenged by the stuff there. I know I’m forgetting a lot of titles, and there’s a lot of stuff I’ve had a hard time getting ahold of. I also feel like the library is a bit too serious right now, maybe, and I’m worried about how obviously skewed it is. I don’t need it to be a “neutral” thing, but I’m noticing some glaring gaps in the sort of content I’d like there. Can’t hurt to have more incentive to read though!\nI’d like to someday tackle a more ambitious digital librarianship project that really digs into databases and complex methods of sorting data, but for now…check it out!\n","description":"","tags":"site updates","title":"Site Updates","uri":"/blog/post/site-updates-3/"},{"content":"","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Cole (small and kittified)","uri":"/nexus/cole/"},{"content":"I recently decided it might improve user experience to get a loading screen instead of watching the grid unceremoniously disentangle itself.

UPDATE: so neocities does not let you host mp3 files. this file limitation stuff has been killing me…first no toml now this! sad! the rain sounds have been replaced by wind chimes for now. was thinking about switching it up once a month? there is now a preloader screen! i briefly looked into skeleton loaders, which are apparently better practice, but i am just so tired. the preloader is pretty simple, but i actually struggled more than i care to admit, so maybe i should post how i did it more comprehensively soon. tweaked the layout and fixed a bug that made the navigation bar unusable on mobile. admittedly, i’ve always been pretty negligent when it comes to optimizing sites, so this learning endeavor is very new. hopefully this makes for a better UI experience if nothing else. if stuff looks odd, clearing your cache (ctrl + f5) might fix it. feel free to report any issues though.\nTIP OF THE DAY in VS code, did you know you can create multiple cursors for super fast edits by holding alt while you click? it’s true! reading the docs is actually helpful it turns out.\nETC. i wish i had cool life anecdotes to offer, but i have done nothing but this lately! here’s the soundtrack to my web dev stuff these days…\nman this has been a lot to deal with. i am going to go smoke and reply to emails like god intended.\n","description":"","tags":"site updates","title":"Site Updates ...Continued!","uri":"/blog/post/site-updates-2/"},{"content":"i started making this website around 3 weeks ago. if you told me then that within that time, i’d write the site, then re-write it with web components, then re-write it again except with a static site generator, i’d believe you. i have a near-pathological need for clear, simple, clean things. my closet is sorted by color and item type. i buy little desk dividers to keep my drawers tidy. the only icon on my desktop is the recycle bin.\nso yes, i have marie kondo’d the site. this has happened before, so i probably should have anticipated it. i was already planning to make some changes, and then one thing just led to another.\nnew library i have broken up with a few frameworks for muuri, an extremely versatile javascript library layout engine. seriously, it combines 3 (!!) frameworks i was using. AND enables the draggable windows. i’m still pretty intimidated by muuri as it requires a bit more configuration than i’m comfortable with yet, but i’m working it out. big thanks to this codepen for the gallery filter. anyways, look, drag and drop! expect things to be buggy, especially on mobile. but what are you doing on mobile anyways…grow up! just kidding. i’ll debug it eventually. probably.\nnow built with hugo you may also notice blog posts are different! that’s actually what started this whole endeavor. i finally decided that hugo is famous for building blogs for a reason and i’ve been wanting to learn more about taxonomies anyways. (now blog posts have tags and this lowkey looks like a tumblr blog. can’t help wandering home…)\nmoving the site to hugo was pretty agonizing at times, but i feel good about it. with the help of shortcodes and partials, i shrank my code to something much more manageable and legible. my gallery page went from 452 lines to 266 lines! the markup is shorter and much easier to understand. and markdown is just soo much easier to deal with than HTML. plus i finally finished moving (most of) my files off of dropbox and can rest assured they’re easier to sort.\nbefore:\nafter:\nanother example, pulled from the links page.\nbefore:\nafter:\nsee what i mean…that’s hugo baby…\ncomment sections \u0026 new guestbook there are also now comment sections for blog posts!! i don’t really know how they work since they’re untested, but feel free to leave one? yeah. i also replaced the guestbook. i think the old guestbook service was cute and stuff, but it’s (1) not responsive, (2) not very customizable, (3) has ads, (4) an external site, and (5) has poor security practices. so we’ll see how that goes? yeah!\nnew content \u0026 RSS feed i added a few windows to the home page! it now has a blog feed (btw, the RSS feed has been updated! old one is deprecated.) a few new links here and there, some formatting updates, the commissions page is slooowly in progress.\nclosing anyways, it’ll be good to get this over with for now. i get really fixated on tasks and it’s hard to step away until it’s over with. (although, i did find the time to open submissions for cicada. blinks slowly at you.) i’ve been learning a ton about hugo and javascript lately and i think i want to pivot back to writing and drawing for a bit. oh, and i’m still moving technically LMAO.\nhopefully the neocities CLI tool is actually easy to use and i don’t die. i know Nothing about ruby. i might make a few tutorials in the future, but i guess i worry about giving bad information since i suspect there’s still lots that i’m doing wrong. still, whatever works, works, so you can expect Something. i’ll get this site up on github soon enough. blegh. i’m tired.\nok talk to you later. here is a song for you.\nEDIT: ok i’m in hell why is the site so slow. it is so fast on my machine and yet so slow on the internet. science explain. gonna compress my images some more. also note to anyone who may need to be reminded: remember to push your PUBLIC folder to neocities not your project folder. it won’t work and your heart will drop…trust me…\n","description":"","tags":"site updates","title":"Site Overhaul","uri":"/blog/post/site-overhaul/"},{"content":"first off, here’s the demo:\nSee the Pen web components card demo by jay (@kujara1) on CodePen. my coding backstory (sad violin) the first time i made a Real Website (cicada), i had never heard of DRY code. DRY stands for “don’t repeat yourself,” and it’s often cited as one of the most important guiding principles for both backend and frontend coding. it isn’t a hard rule, but the consensus tends to be that if you repeat the same code more than three times, you may want to consider making it repeatable.\nbut i didn’t know this back then. my experience was limited to single pages and tumblr themes, so i’d never thought about page management before. at first, it wasn’t so bad. copying and pasting the stylesheets, scripts, header, footer—it’s manageable for your core pages. but we were running a litmag, and this meant publishing issues that were usually at least 30 pages, and sometimes hit over 50.\ni dreaded the task every semester. it was a time consuming and tedious nightmare that no one wanted to help me with (for obvious reasons.) invariably, i’d mess up the copy and pasting at some point, and then multiple pages would have mistakes. i had to explain to our managing editor that it’d take days to change any navigation links because i’d have to manually update every single page. he just stared at me.\ni knew this was Wrong, but i kept telling myself that this wasn’t my real job, so i had no reason to learn a better way—i was a graphic design major, not a computer scientist! this was just my flimsy bandaid solution until a proper web developer finally applied and saved the day!\nthat never happened. CCM has existed since 2018, and we have never had one single person apply to be web developer. it has always just been me, tearfully wondering if that numb feeling in my wrist was of concern as i tried to copy and paste dozens of pages worth of identical content. things came to a head when i discovered that i’d been paying money for a dynamic site host when i could have been hosting it for free. embarrassing! harrowing! exhausting!\ni felt defeated. there was so much i didn’t know and i was at a loss of where to even begin. i knew so little that i didn’t even know the right search terms to input. there is so much information floating out there that it’s overwhelming. i considered giving up.\ninstead, i took the site down for 6 months and learned.\nstatic site generators what i ultimately did was use a static site generator, which i highly recommend for anyone with a project that has as many pages as we did. i used hugo, and although i haven’t tried out other static site generators, i am deeply in love with it to the point it now feels weird making stuff without it. the learning curve is intimidating, and it takes a lot of time to get comfortable with it, but you’ll get there. i struggled a lot because i had to create a theme from scratch and the theme had a lot of interactive components that i didn’t have enough skill to execute effectively, but the hugo community was super helpful and active. and if you’re using pre-made themes, it’s not hard to get started.\nhugo elegantly resolves the issue of repeatable code snippets through things like partials and shortcodes. static site generators in general were formulated with goals like this in mind. jekyll lets you use includes and gatsby has layout components.\nstatic site generators aim to make things very, very simple for you. they tend to prioritize markdown over HTML and encourage modularity in all design components. this is excellent for information, text-dense websites in particular.\nbut maybe it’s not so great for people who have small websites, for people who don’t want to be bound by templates (even of their own creation), or maybe it’s just more support than you need. and it certainly presents an additional challenge when deploying somewhere like neocities. so are there other solutions?\nweb components i recognized a familiar feeling as i was working on this site. i was copying and pasting the card header, which is a bit dense due to how it’s constructed (bootstrap columns + fontawesome icons). by the 20th card header across pages, i was officially twitchy. then, as i was copying and pasting my start menu, my brain started melting. i cannot go through this again, i decided. i’d told myself it’d be fine since it’s only a few pages, but it’s too late. i know the truth now. there’s no good reason to repeat components that often.\nit made me realize i still fundamentally hadn’t found a solution for repeatable HTML components. sure, static site generators can solve that issue for me, but how was i going to do with a service like neocities that was intentionally whittled down to the bare essentials?\na lot of people on neocities seem to like iframes, but i don’t think they’re well-suited to this particular use-case. they’re not simple code snippet injections, they’re entire html files being injected into another html file. you have to style each individual iframe because it won’t inherit the parent page’s styling—which ends up undermining the goal of keeping your code DRY.\ncue…web components!! mdn docs cover web components here as well. long story short, web components are a suite of tools you can utilize with vanilla javascript to create all sorts of repeatable code. i’ve been told they funtion a lot like react.js components. here’s a crash course video on web components and the accompanying codepen.\nas of writing this, i’ve only needed to use custom elements, which are fairly simple to use:\nfirst, you create your reusable HTML snippet. then, you create a javascript file, decide on the name of your component, and build it. the syntax generally looks like this: class TITLE extends HTMLElement {\rconstructor() {\rsuper();\rthis.innerHTML = `insert your HTML here`;\r}\r}\rwindow.customElements.define('TITLE-ID', TITLE)\rfrom there, you can link the component and invoke the code in your HTML like \u003cTITLE-ID\u003e\u003c/TITLE-ID\u003e note: your title-id must be two words combined with a hyphen. your title can be whatever you like though. note: remember to include the ` tags when you insert your HTML. i currently use six components and they alone have saved me well over 1k lines of code. hopefully you find some utility in this post and can get started with repeatable snippets too. love \u0026 peace on planet earth!\n","description":"","tags":"tutorials","title":"Reusable HTML Snippets: Web Components","uri":"/blog/post/web-components/"},{"content":"\rCOMMISSIONS\rstatus\npricing\nterms\nko-fi wind chimes #COMMISSION STATUS\rCommissions are currently closed.
